Below is an experimental version of CTGAP referred to by Apsu's [APT Keyboard Layout](https://github.com/Apsu/APT). I deleted the original repo in mid June 2021, but I feel that it makes sense to address it here.

CTGAP 2.0 (Deprecated)
```

   W  C  L  D  K   J  Y  O  U  ?  _  }  |

   r  s  t  h  m   p  n  e  i  a  ;

Note: This page is a WIP. I plan to add:
- Analyses of CTGAP 3.0 and 2.0 with Semi's Genkey analyzer
- Analyses of CTGAP 3.0 and 2.0 with IanDoug's KLAnext analyzer
- CTGAP 3.0 downloads for Windows, MacOS, and Linux
- Personal QMK Keymaps of CTGAP 3.0 for Dactyl Manuform 3x5/4x5 and Corne/CRKBD 3x5
